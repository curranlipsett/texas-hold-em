Texas Hold'em game written in Python

I am going to write this program as a way to get more comfortable using python as an object-oriented language. I will add more information to the readme as the program evolves, but for now I would like to create a text based game, that can be played by at least two players (no computer) and create a betting and scoring system to keep the game interesting.
